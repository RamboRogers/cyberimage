  - Added logic to `initializeGenerationForm` to load `lastStepsValue` from `localStorage` and apply it to the steps slider and display.
  - Added event listener to steps slider (`input`) to save its value to `localStorage`.
  - Added logic to form `submit` event listener to save both current `modelId` and `stepsValue` to `localStorage`.

### [DATE] Backend Model Step Configuration
- Updated `.env.example` and `.env`:
  - Modified format comment to include optional `<options_json>`.
  - Added `MODEL_4` entry for `sana-sprint` with `{\"fixed_steps\": 2}` configuration.
- Modified `app/utils/config.py` (`parse_model_config` function):
  - Updated logic to parse the optional 6th semicolon-separated part as a JSON string.

  - Stored the parsed dictionary (or empty dict if invalid/missing) into the `step_config` key for each model in `models_config`.
- Verified `app/api/routes.py` (`/api/models` endpoint): Confirmed it returns the `AVAILABLE_MODELS` dictionary directly, which now includes the `step_config` data. No changes needed.

### [DATE] Frontend Step Configuration Handling

  - In `initializeModels`:
    - Created `modelsDataStore` to hold the full configuration fetched for each model.
    - Populated `modelsDataStore` while creating model select options.
  - In the `#model` select `change` event listener:
    - Retrieved the full data object (`selectedModelData`) for the chosen model ID from `modelsDataStore`.
    - Accessed the `step_config` from `selectedModelData`.
    - Added logic to check `step_config` for `fixed_steps` or a `steps` range (`min`, `max`, `default`).
    - Updated the `#steps` slider's `min`, `max`, `value`, and `disabled` attributes based on the configuration.
    - Prioritized `localStorage` value for steps if it's within the allowed range (for non-fixed models).
    - Updated the `#steps-value` display.
    - Saved the potentially adjusted steps value back to `localStorage`.
    - Added fallback to reset slider to defaults if no model is selected or data is missing.

## Current Focus
Completed Phase 5: Testing & Optimization
All planned phases are now complete!

## [YYYY-MM-DD] - Add Video Generation Feature (Initial Phase)

- **API.md:** Added documentation for new `/api/generate_video` endpoint and corresponding `GET /get_video/<video_id>`.
- **NOTES.md:** Documented design, model details, API endpoint, planned changes for video generation.
- **Planned Changes:**
    - `app/models/manager.py`: Add imports, video model config, update `get_model`, add `generate_video` stub.
    - `app/templates/index.html`: Add ðŸŽ¥ button.
    - `app/templates/gallery.html`: Add ðŸŽ¥ button.
    - [x] Backend route for `/api/generate_video` (in `app/api/routes.py`).
    - [x] `GenerationPipeline.process_job` update for video jobs (in `app/models/generator.py`).
    - Frontend JS for modal and video handling.

## [YYYY-MM-DD] - Image-to-Video Model Detection Fix

- **Issue:** The application was failing to recognize "wan-i2v-14b" as a valid image-to-video model, causing an error: "Error: Model wan-i2v-14b is not a video generation model".
- **Fix:**
  - Updated `app/static/js/main.js`:
    - Modified `openVideoGenModal()` function to detect I2V models based on either:
      - Model's type property being 'i2v' OR
      - Model ID containing 'i2v' in its name
    - Added fallback description for models missing description field
  - This change allows proper detection of I2V models regardless of server-side type configuration

## [YYYY-MM-DD] - Main Form T2V/T2I Integration

- **Goal:** Allow Text-to-Video (T2V) generation directly from the main prompt form, alongside Text-to-Image (T2I).
- **Changes in `app/static/js/main.js`:**
  - Added `API_T2V_GEN` constant (`/api/generate_t2v`).
  - Modified `initializeModels()`:
    - Filters models for the main dropdown to include types 'image' and 't2v'.
    - Stores model type information.
    - Adds type label (`[Image]` or `[Video]`) to dropdown options.
  - Modified `handleModelChange()`:
    - Updates the main generate button text ("Generate Image" or "Generate Video") based on selected model type.
  - Modified `initializeGenerationForm()` submit handler:
    - Detects the selected model's type ('image' or 't2v').
    - Sets `apiUrl` to the correct endpoint (`API_IMAGE_GEN` or `API_T2V_GEN`).
    - Builds the appropriate `requestData` payload for the selected type (including `settings.type`).
    - Uses a `feedbackType` ('Image' or 'Video') for UI messages.
  - Modified `pollGenerationStatus()`:
    - Added `feedbackType` parameter to display correct messages (e.g., "Generating Video...").

## [YYYY-MM-DD] - Fix Video Export Data Type

- **Issue:** Video output (specifically from LTX-Video T2V model) was corrupt.
- **Root Cause:** The model pipeline returned frames as a Python `list`, but the `diffusers.utils.export_to_video` function expects a NumPy `ndarray`.
- **Fix:**
  - Modified `app/models/generator.py` (`process_job` method):
    - Within the T2V and I2V generation blocks, added a check before calling `export_to_video`.
    - If the `frames` variable is a `list`, convert it to a NumPy `ndarray` using `np.array()` list comprehension and `np.stack()`. Log the conversion.
    - If `frames` is already an `ndarray`, proceed as before (with existing debug logs).
    - Added error handling for the conversion process.
- **Affected Files:**
  - `app/models/generator.py`

## [YYYY-MM-DD] - Further Debugging LTX Video Export

- **Issue:** Video output still corrupt ("green lines") even after converting frame list to NumPy array.
- **Investigation:** Compared code to reference, identified potential issues:
    1.  **Dtype Mismatch:** LTX GGUF model loading in `get_model` wasn't strictly using `torch.bfloat16` as in reference.
    2.  **Frame Format:** The frames returned by `generate_text_to_video` might be Tensors, not PIL Images, causing incorrect conversion to `uint8` NumPy array in `generator.py`.
- **Fixes Applied:**
    1.  Modified `app/models/manager.py` (`get_model`): Changed LTX GGUF loading to consistently use `torch.bfloat16`.
    2.  Modified `app/models/manager.py` (`generate_text_to_video`): Added debug logging before returning `output_frames` to inspect their type, dtype, shape, and range (if tensor).
- **Next Steps:** Analyze new logs to determine frame format and adjust conversion logic in `app/models/generator.py` if necessary.
- **Affected Files:**
    - `app/models/manager.py`

## [YYYY-MM-DD] - Fix NameError in Video Debug Logging

- **Issue:** Generation failed with `NameError: name 'Image' is not defined`.
- **Root Cause:** Debug logging added in `generate_text_to_video` (`manager.py`) referenced `Image.Image` without the necessary `from PIL import Image` import.
- **Fix:** Added `from PIL import Image` at the top of `app/models/manager.py`.
- **Affected Files:**
  - `app/models/manager.py`

## [YYYY-MM-DD] - Address Video Distortion

- **Issue:** After previous fixes, video was generated but appeared distorted.
- **Investigation:** Compared application code flow to reference, identified key difference in `negative_prompt` handling.
- **Root Cause:** Application used `None` for `negative_prompt` if user provided none, while reference code used a specific quality-enhancing prompt (`"worst quality, inconsistent motion, blurry, jittery, distorted"`).
- **Fix:** Modified `generate_text_to_video` in `app/models/manager.py` to default to the reference negative prompt if none is provided in the job settings.
- **Affected Files:**
  - `app/models/manager.py`
