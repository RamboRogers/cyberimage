- Set up requirements.txt with carefully selected dependencies
- Initialized Flask application with:
  - CORS support
  - Configuration management
  - Health check endpoint
- Created API blueprint with initial routes

### [DATE] Phase 3 Implementation
- Created image management system with:
  - Organized storage structure (by date)
  - Database tracking
  - Metadata support
- Implemented comprehensive API endpoints:
  - POST /api/generate - Submit generation requests
  - GET /api/status/<job_id> - Check job status
  - GET /api/image/<image_id> - Retrieve generated images
  - GET /api/image/<image_id>/metadata - Get image metadata
  - GET /api/queue - View queue status
- Added input validation and error handling
- Integrated all components (Queue, Model, Image managers)

### [DATE] Phase 4 Implementation
- Created generation pipeline:
  - Job processing system
  - Error handling and recovery
  - Automatic cleanup of stalled jobs
- Enhanced model manager:
  - Improved error handling
  - Memory optimization
  - Performance improvements
  - Detailed logging
- Implemented worker process:
  - Background job processing
  - Graceful shutdown handling
  - Resource cleanup
- Added generation optimizations:
  - Memory efficient attention
  - Inference mode
  - Default parameters

### [DATE] Phase 5 Implementation
- Implemented comprehensive logging system:
  - Rotating file handlers
  - Separate logs for app, errors, and models
  - Structured log formats
  - Log level configuration
- Added rate limiting:
  - Per-IP request tracking
  - Configurable limits
  - Automatic cleanup
- Enhanced error handling:
  - Custom API error class
  - Consistent error responses
  - Detailed error logging
- Added performance optimizations:
  - Memory efficient attention (xformers)
  - Half-precision (FP16) support
  - Configurable cleanup intervals
  - Optimized model loading
- Improved configuration:
  - Added rate limit settings
  - Performance tuning options
  - Default generation parameters

### [DATE] Frontend Enhancements (localStorage)
- Modified `app/static/js/main.js`:
  - Added logic to `initializeModels` to load `lastModelId` from `localStorage` and apply it to the model select.
  - Added logic to model select `change` event listener to save the selected `modelId` to `localStorage`.
  - Added logic to `initializeGenerationForm` to load `lastStepsValue` from `localStorage` and apply it to the steps slider and display.
  - Added event listener to steps slider (`input`) to save its value to `localStorage`.
  - Added logic to form `submit` event listener to save both current `modelId` and `stepsValue` to `localStorage`.

### [DATE] Backend Model Step Configuration
- Updated `.env.example` and `.env`:
  - Modified format comment to include optional `<options_json>`.
  - Added `MODEL_4` entry for `sana-sprint` with `{\"fixed_steps\": 2}` configuration.
- Modified `app/utils/config.py` (`parse_model_config` function):
  - Updated logic to parse the optional 6th semicolon-separated part as a JSON string.
  - Added JSON parsing with error handling for the options string.
  - Stored the parsed dictionary (or empty dict if invalid/missing) into the `step_config` key for each model in `models_config`.
- Verified `app/api/routes.py` (`/api/models` endpoint): Confirmed it returns the `AVAILABLE_MODELS` dictionary directly, which now includes the `step_config` data. No changes needed.

### [DATE] Frontend Step Configuration Handling
- Modified `app/static/js/main.js`:
  - In `initializeModels`:
    - Created `modelsDataStore` to hold the full configuration fetched for each model.
    - Populated `modelsDataStore` while creating model select options.
  - In the `#model` select `change` event listener:
    - Retrieved the full data object (`selectedModelData`) for the chosen model ID from `modelsDataStore`.
    - Accessed the `step_config` from `selectedModelData`.
    - Added logic to check `step_config` for `fixed_steps` or a `steps` range (`min`, `max`, `default`).
    - Updated the `#steps` slider's `min`, `max`, `value`, and `disabled` attributes based on the configuration.
    - Prioritized `localStorage` value for steps if it's within the allowed range (for non-fixed models).
    - Updated the `#steps-value` display.
    - Saved the potentially adjusted steps value back to `localStorage`.
    - Added fallback to reset slider to defaults if no model is selected or data is missing.
